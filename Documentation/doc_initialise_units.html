		Once the PF is solved, the initialization of the control systems of the units is done, imposing the terminal voltages and currents (in d-q axis). Then, each unit is loaded in a separate Simulink file, and trimmed to get the steady state values for all states.
		
		Once the initialization of the control systems of the units is done, the grid block is prepared for dynamic analysis. This is done by selecting the ``Dynamic'' block as the active choice of the grid variant system. Simulink then treats the Loadflow model as a commented block.
