		To determine state variables not captured during the initial power flow (PF) analysis, a gradient-based optimization process in MATLAB can be automatically applied to each Simulink block. This optimization is constrained by the initial PF results, ensuring accuracy. For straightforward blocks, you can streamline future calculations by manually deriving and storing initial condition equations directly within the block. A crucial part of this process involves recalculating constant-impedance load values. This recalculation ensures these loads precisely consume the active and reactive power previously identified by the PF solution.
